.. py:class:: BasePainter

   Bases: :py:obj:`abc.ABC`

   Abstract base class for all pipeline painters.


   .. py:property:: available_formats
      :type: Sequence[str]
      :abstractmethod:

      List of the available formats to render the
      computational graph into.

   .. py:method:: from_pipeline(pipeline)
      :abstractmethod:

      Method for drawing the `pipeline` and saving the
      result into internal representation.


   .. py:method:: from_executor(executor)
      :abstractmethod:

      Method for drawing the pipeline connected with the `executor`
      and saving the result into internal representation. The drawn
      graph should represent executor's behaviour.


   .. py:method:: render(output_filename, format = None)
      :abstractmethod:

      Method for saving drawn computational graph.

      :param output_filename: Path (containing the filename) where the output graphics file will be saved.
      :param format: Format of the output file. If `None`, then the `output_filename` determines the format.



.. py:class:: GraphvizPainter(graph_levels_sep = 1.0, figure_dpi = 150, figure_rankdir = 'LR', render_groups = True)

   Bases: :py:obj:`bosk.painter.base.BasePainter`

   Painter that uses Graphviz library to draw the computational graph of a pipeline.

   .. attribute:: levels_sep

      The painter's parameter, which determines the distance between the computational graph's levels.
      See http://graphviz.org/docs/attrs/ranksep/.

   .. attribute:: dpi

      The dpi of the output computational graph images, formated in raster graphics (.png, .jpeg, etc.).

   .. attribute:: rankdir

      The direction of the computational graph edges. See https://graphviz.org/docs/attrs/rankdir/.

   :param graph_levels_sep: Sets :attr:`levels_sep`.
   :param figure_dpi: Sets :attr:`dpi`.
   :param figure_rankdir: Sets :attr:`rankdir`.

   .. py:property:: rankdir
      :type: str

      //graphviz.org/docs/attrs/rankdir/.

      :type: The direction of the computational graph edges. See https

   .. py:property:: levels_sep
      :type: float

      The painter's parameter, which determines the distance between the computational graph's levels.
      See http://graphviz.org/docs/attrs/ranksep/.

   .. py:property:: dpi
      :type: int

      The dpi of the output computational graph images, formated in raster graphics (.png, .jpeg, etc.).

   .. py:method:: _add_node(block, style = 'solid', color = 'black')

      Method that adds a node to the graph.



   .. py:method:: _add_edge(connection, style = 'solid', color = 'black')

      Method that adds an edge to the graph.



   .. py:method:: _add_input(name, input_slot, style = 'solid', color = 'red')

      Method that adds pipeline's input to the graph.



   .. py:method:: _add_output(name, output_slot, style = 'solid', color = 'red')

      Method that adds pipeline's output to the graph.



   .. py:method:: from_pipeline(pipeline)

      Method that parses a pipeline and make internal representation
      of the computational graph to render its image in the :meth:`render` method.


   .. py:method:: from_executor(executor)
      :abstractmethod:

      Method for drawing the pipeline connected with the `executor`
      and saving the result into internal representation. The drawn
      graph should represent executor's behaviour.


   .. py:method:: render(output_filename, format = None)

      Method that renders the computational graph's image.



   .. py:method:: available_formats()

      List of the available formats to render the
      computational graph into.



.. py:class:: TopologicalPainter(graph_levels_sep = 1, figure_dpi = 150, figure_rankdir = 'LR')

   Bases: :py:obj:`bosk.painter.graphviz.GraphvizPainter`

   Painter that performes the computational graph drawing in accordance with :class:`TopologicalExecutor`.
   Based on the :class:`GraphvizPainter`.

   .. attribute:: levels_sep

      The painter's parameter, which determines the distance between the computational graph's levels.
      See http://graphviz.org/docs/attrs/ranksep/.

   .. attribute:: dpi

      The dpi of the output computational graph images, formated in raster graphics (.png, .jpeg, etc.).

   .. attribute:: rankdir

      The direction of the computational graph edges. See https://graphviz.org/docs/attrs/rankdir/.

   :param graph_levels_sep: Sets :attr:`levels_sep`.
   :param figure_dpi: Sets :attr:`dpi`.
   :param figure_rankdir: Sets :attr:`rankdir`.

   .. py:method:: from_executor(executor)

      Method that parses a :class:`TopologicalExecutor` and make internal representation
      of the computational graph to render its image in the :meth:`render` method.

      * The solid black edges and nodes are the ones that will be used during calculations.
      * The dashed will be skipped during the optimization.
      * The red colored nodes mean used inputs and outputs, the red colored edges signalize that
        type of the block's input slot was misspecified: according to the :attr:`stage` metainformation
        the connection should be used, but the corresponding block won't be used because of the optimization.
      * The blue colored nodes mean skipped inputs and outputs. They were specified in the pipeline,
          but not in the executor.
