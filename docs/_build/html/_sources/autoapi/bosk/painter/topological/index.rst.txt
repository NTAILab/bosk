.. py:class:: TopologicalPainter(graph_levels_sep = 1, figure_dpi = 150, figure_rankdir = 'LR')

   Bases: :py:obj:`bosk.painter.graphviz.GraphvizPainter`

   Painter that performes the computational graph drawing in accordance with :class:`TopologicalExecutor`.
   Based on the :class:`GraphvizPainter`.

   .. attribute:: levels_sep

      The painter's parameter, which determines the distance between the computational graph's levels.
      See http://graphviz.org/docs/attrs/ranksep/.

   .. attribute:: dpi

      The dpi of the output computational graph images, formated in raster graphics (.png, .jpeg, etc.).

   .. attribute:: rankdir

      The direction of the computational graph edges. See https://graphviz.org/docs/attrs/rankdir/.

   :param graph_levels_sep: Sets :attr:`levels_sep`.
   :param figure_dpi: Sets :attr:`dpi`.
   :param figure_rankdir: Sets :attr:`rankdir`.

   .. py:method:: from_executor(executor)

      Method that parses a :class:`TopologicalExecutor` and make internal representation
      of the computational graph to render its image in the :meth:`render` method.

      * The solid black edges and nodes are the ones that will be used during calculations.
      * The dashed will be skipped during the optimization.
      * The red colored nodes mean used inputs and outputs, the red colored edges signalize that
        type of the block's input slot was misspecified: according to the :attr:`stage` metainformation
        the connection should be used, but the corresponding block won't be used because of the optimization.
      * The blue colored nodes mean skipped inputs and outputs. They were specified in the pipeline,
          but not in the executor.
